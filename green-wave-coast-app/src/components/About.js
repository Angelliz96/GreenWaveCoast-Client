              <p>
                GreenWaveCoast was born out of a shared passion for the breathtaking beauty and ecological diversity of Clatsop County. Inspired by the pristine coastline, lush forests, and vibrant communities that call this region home, a group of like-minded individuals came together with a shared vision: to promote sustainability and environmental conservation in our beloved coastal community. Our journey began with a simple question: How can we protect and preserve the natural wonders of Clatsop County for future generations? Determined to find answers, we embarked on a mission to raise awareness, inspire action, and effect positive change. From humble beginnings as a grassroots movement, GreenWaveCoast has grown into a dynamic platform for environmental advocacy, education, and outreach. Through our ongoing efforts, we've mobilized individuals, businesses, and policymakers to embrace sustainable practices and prioritize the health and well-being of our planet. But our story is far from over. As we continue to navigate the challenges of the 21st century, we remain steadfast in our commitment to building a more sustainable future—one where people and nature thrive in harmony. Join us on this journey as we work together to create a greener, healthier, and more resilient Clatsop County for generations to come.
